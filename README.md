# EduPair ðŸ“˜

EduPair is a minimalist VSCode extension built for academic use, allowing instructors to generate both student and solution versions of a Jupyter notebook from a single annotated source. By marking specific lines or blocks of code with lightweight comments (e.g., # HIDE, # HIDE-INLINE, # BEGIN HIDE), EduPair automatically produces two clean variants: one for students with code replaced by placeholders like `...`, and one full solution version.

EduPair was developed in just a few hours to support a specific academic need. While I've aimed to follow good development practices, this is a minimal prototype intended to serve a narrow purpose. Itâ€™s a small utility built to streamline my own workflow, and it's provided as-is, with no guarantees beyond that.
